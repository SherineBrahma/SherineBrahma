##  Hi, I'm Sherine 👋

I'm an Electrical Engineer specializing in signal processing, optimization, and deep learning. My work focuses on MRI reconstruction and quantitative MR imaging. On a lighter note, I also enjoy playing around with audio analog circuits and audio plugins.

I'm a guitarist and music producer, drawn particularly to soul, RnB, jazz, and funk, among other styles (I will upload some things soon 😊). Furthermore, I grew up with sports and have especially enjoyed basketball and table tennis.

Currently based in Berlin, I'm interested in engineering, healthcare, creativity, and most importantly, dumb humor.
